# Getting started

System Requirements:

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) 20 or later
- macOS, Windows (including WSL), and Linux are supported
- A database URI that you can use for testing (MongoDB, PostgreSQL, MySQL and MariaDB are supported)

You can directly browse and experiment with existing examples from the [official GitHub](https://github.com/openizr/perseid/tree/main/examples/) repository. Please note that you will need [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) installed on your machine for this.

In this quick start guide, we'll be using the MongoDB/Express/React stack, but you are free to choose any other supported stack.
