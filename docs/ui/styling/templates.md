# Templates

Basic styling for available components.

Templates are SASS files that provide very basic styling for all available components. They are a good start to build your design system from scratch. To use them, simply copy/paste the `templates` directory into your project - or better, `@import '@perseid/ui/templates'`, and you're good to go!
